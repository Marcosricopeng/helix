This directory contains the demo-task that is used in
org.apache.helix.task.TestDemoDynamicTaskLoading. The
resulting JAR file is copied to "src/test/resources".
You can either change the path in the test script to point to
the JAR file in this directory, or copy the JAR file to
"src/test/resources" if you want to rebuild the project. After
this step, simply run the test in
org.apache.helix.task.TestDemoDynamicTaskLoading for the demo.
